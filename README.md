# TrumpTweetAnalyzing

## Overview

Data from Kaggle [Trump Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/trump-tweets)

Only a small practice project in order to figure out the whole process of NLP, except web crawling.

I am already available to use libs such as requests and selenium to get text from web pages so I simply use the existed dataset to make this project easier. It is time waste for me to apply for a tweeter dev account or write a script for data.
