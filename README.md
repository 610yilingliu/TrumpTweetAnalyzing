# TrumpTweetAnalyzing

## Overview

Data from Kaggle [Trump Tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/austinreese/trump-tweets)

Only a small practice project in order to figure out the whole process of NLP, except web crawling.

I don't really want to apply for a twitter dev account for achieve data so simply download the existed dataset. That dataset contains Trump's tweet from 2009 to 2020.6.
